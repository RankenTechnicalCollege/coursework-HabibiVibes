<hr>


    <p>Section 1.1.1 provides an overview of non-text content that can be used such as sensory, time based media and CAPTCHA. You can also decorate using<br>
visual aids such as images, emojis, and videos.</p>

    <p>Section 1.2 goes over time based media, captions, audio descriptions, sign language, and the difference between pre recorded and live media and<br>
hot to use it</p>

    <p>Section 1.3 is about being adaptable. Knowing how to have good content orientation, using sensory characteristics to identify items that otherwise<br>
rely on sensory information to be understood, and having a meaningful sequence to your website layout</p>

    <p> Section 1.4 is all about being distinguishable. Separating yourself from the competition. Having good use of color, audio control, usage of text size<br>
having low or no background audi, and just an overall good visual presentation.</p>
