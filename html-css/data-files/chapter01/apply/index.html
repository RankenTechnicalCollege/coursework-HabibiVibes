	<p>I am using Visual Studios as my editor for this assignment</p>

	<p>To plan a website you need to figure out the purpose of the website, target audience, while considering diversity and using multi-platform<br>

	<p>In chapter 1 I have learned to define key terms, recognize protocols, identify web browsers main features, the process of creating a website,<br>
designing for accessability, and creating my own basic .html page</p>
