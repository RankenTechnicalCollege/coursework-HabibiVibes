                <h2>Sticky</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a sticky position. Its position is based on the user's scroll position.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to briefly explain how to use the sticky position. -->
                <p></p>

            <div class="box relative">

                <h2>Relative</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a relative position. It can move around a little, depending on the viewport, but it is in a position relative to itself.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and left properties and how it affected the relative box. -->
                <p>top: 0px left: 200px. I wanted to set the top back with good alignment; however, I sent the left out 300px to more of the center of the page.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box fixed">

                <h2>Fixed</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with a fixed position. Its position is relative to the viewport.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the top and right properties and how it affected the fixed box. -->
                <p>top: 60px right: 30px. I brought the top down equal to the stick position and kept the right at an equal spaced distance</p>

            </div>

            <div class="box absolute">

                <h2>Absolute</h2>
                <p>This is an example of an element with an absolute position. It is similar to the fixed position; however, it is positioned relative to the closest parent element.</p>
                <!-- Use the empty paragraph element below to identify the values you used for the bottom and right properties and how it affected the absolute box. -->
                <p>bottom: 50px right: 280px I moved it to the center with equal spacing </p>
