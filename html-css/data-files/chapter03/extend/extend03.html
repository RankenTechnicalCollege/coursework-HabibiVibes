            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Descriptive file names are important because they offer a snapshot of the file's content, enabling you to find the right file quickly<br>
                and without confusion</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I had to download and use microsoft paint to resize the html5 photo down to 500 x 333 pixels.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original image size was 2121 x 1414 </p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5 new.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="500" width="333">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used tinyjpg.com to compress my image. The size of the file before the compression was 27.29KB and after compression it was 21.88KB</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="500" width="333">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>the difference between the two is file size and image quality. Often chosen by the photographers needs.</p>

          <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used w3 schools to learn about using SVG graphics in HTML.</p>
