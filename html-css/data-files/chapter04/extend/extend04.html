                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify the online color converter you used to complete this assignment. Include an absolute link to your resource and include the target attribute to open the page in a new tab. -->
                <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">Color Converter Used: W3Schools Color Picker</a></p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to compare and contrast your findings regarding hexadecimal, RGB, and HSL color codes. -->
                <p>Hexadecimal: Compact/widely supported. But its hard to interpret the color without a tool.</p>
                <p>RGB: More intuitive than hex. Easier to visualize the color. But not as compact as hex.</p>
                <p>HSL: Most intuitive. Easier to adjust colors (like lightness). But not as widely supported as hex or RGB.</p>

                <!-- Use the paragraph element below to identify your preferred color code format (hexadecimal, RBG, or HSL) and why. -->
                <p>Preferred color code format: rgb(red, green, blue)<br>
                Example: rgb(255, 87, 51)<br> 
                         rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5) (50% transparent)</p>
                <p>Reason: RGB is more intuitive than hex and easier to visualize the color. It is also widely supported.</p>
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss HWB color. -->
                <p>HWB summary:<br>
                Hue, Whiteness, Blackness (HWB) is a cylindrical color model that represents colors in terms of their hue, whiteness, and blackness components. It is designed to be more intuitive for humans to understand and manipulate colors compared to other color models like RGB or HSL.<br>
                HWB is particularly useful for applications where users need to select or adjust colors based on their perceptual attributes, such as in graphic design or user interface design.</p>
                
                <!-- Use the paragraph element to discuss CMYK color. -->
                <p>CMYK summary:<br>
                CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black) is a subtractive color model used in color printing. It is based on the principle that colors are created by subtracting light from a white background using inks of different colors. The CMYK model is used in the printing industry because it allows for a wide range of colors to be produced using just four ink colors.<br>
                In CMYK, colors are represented as percentages of each of the four ink colors.</p>
