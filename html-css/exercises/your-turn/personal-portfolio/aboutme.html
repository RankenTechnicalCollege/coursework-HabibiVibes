                        <h3>My Background</h3>
                        <p>Hello! I'm Dillon Anderson, a web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                        <p>By trade I am a framing carpenter and finish carpenter; however, in January, I had a bad accident at work which has prevented me from doing that line of work anymore.<br>
                        I plan to bring my work ethic and creative aspects from both my military and construction careers, into my Web Development and coding career.</p>
