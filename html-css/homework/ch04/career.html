                <h1>Personal Background</h1>
                <p>My golf journey began during 2021 out of curiosity. I never played in highschool, although now I wish I had.. I remember watching others on the course, fascinated by the mix<br>
                of skill and patience the game demanded. What began as casual interest quickly turned into something much bigger. Progression. Making contact was first, but then I began to draw<br>
                to the feeling of progression, and improving my swing, learning the strategy behind each shot, and appreciating the mental side of the game.</p>

                <p>Over time, golf became more than just a sport to me-it became a way to spend time outdoors, connect with others, and push myself to grow. What started as a hobby has turned into<br>
                a lifelong passion, and each round continues to teach me something new.</p>
