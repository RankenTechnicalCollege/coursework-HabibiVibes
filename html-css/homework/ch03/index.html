        <h2>My Experience</h2>

        <p>My name is Dillon Anderson, I am 28 years old when first creating this. I had a very bad accident back in January while framing a house, ive had 3 major surgeries that have caused limitations in my range of motion meaning I will never be able to<br>
        frame houses again. Switching to a new career path will be challenging, but I am eager to learn and excited to see what these next couple of years bring.</p>

        <p>This is my first time coding in HTML. I have always been interested in web design and development, but I have never had the opportunity to learn how to code. I am excited to learn more about HTML and CSS and to create my own websites in the future.</p>

        <p>I have heard that coding can be challenging, but I am ready to take on the challenge. I am looking forward to learning new skills and creating something that I can be proud of.</p>

        <p>Overall, I am excited to start my journey into the world of coding and web development. I can't wait to see what I can create!</p>
